## About the project

> CS50AI exercise link: <https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/projects/0/tictactoe/>

The runner.py file was created by the CS50AI staff, so my task as a student was to develop a MiniMax algorithm in order to build a bot able to play TicTacToe and always win or tie.

## Try it yourself

To run the game yourself, just run the following commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/BrenoMorim/tictactoe.git tictactoe
cd tictactoe
virtualenv .venv
source ./.venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python runner.py
```
